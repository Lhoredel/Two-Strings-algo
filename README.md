# Two-Strings-algo
This code solves the Two Strings problem by checking if two strings share any common characters. It stores all characters from the first string in a hash set for efficient O(1) lookups, then scans the second string for any matching characters. The algorithm immediately returns "YES" upon finding any shared character, otherwise returns "NO" after checking all characters.
